# React Notes

### what is react:
> react is a popular declarative, component based, state driven javascript library for uilding user interfaces

### React is based on the following:
> 1. COMPONENTS: building blocks for react.<br />
> 2. REACT IS DECLARATIVE: we describe how components look like using JSX(combines HTML. CSS & JS). declarative means telling react how a component should look like. React is abstract, we never touch the DOM.
> 3. STATE DRIVEN: The main goal of react is to always keep the UI in sync with the data, state is a piece of data or array of data, whenever the state changes, react updates the UI. or React reacts to state changes by re-rendering the UI.
